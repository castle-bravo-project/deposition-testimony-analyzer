The **Deposition Testimony Analyzer** is an advanced instructional and case-management tool designed for legal professionals. It leverages the power of Google's Gemini AI to transform lengthy deposition transcripts into structured, actionable intelligence. By uploading a PDF, users can generate an interactive mind map that assesses testimony veracity, identifies key claims, surfaces inconsistencies, and suggests strategic actions, streamlining case preparation and analysis.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Developer Guide: Installation & Build

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later)
-   npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/deposition-analyzer.git
    cd deposition-analyzer
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Environment Setup**
    This project requires a Google Gemini API key.

    -   Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
    -   Add your API key to the file:
        ```env
        API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
        ```
    The application is configured to use this variable. In the provided development environment, this key is pre-configured and does not need to be set manually.

### Running the App

The project is set up to run directly from the source files using a modern browser that supports ES Modules and import maps. No local development server or build step is required for development. Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## ü§ñ Special Guide: Prompt & Agent Engineering

The core intelligence of this application resides in `services/geminiService.ts`. The prompts are engineered to ensure consistent, structured, and high-quality output from the Gemini model.

### 1. Main Analysis Prompt (`analyzeTestimonyStream`)

This is the most complex prompt, designed to generate the entire mind map in a single, streaming call.

-   **Agent Persona**: The AI is instructed to act as an "AI legal analyst" powering a mind map tool. This sets the context and professional tone.
-   **Output Constraint (CRITICAL)**: The prompt strictly enforces a **raw newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON)** stream. This is non-negotiable for the front-end to work correctly, as it allows the app to parse and render one node at a time, creating the "live-building" effect. Any deviation (like wrapping in `[]` or using markdown fences) would break the parser.
-   **Schema Enforcement**: The prompt defines the exact JSON structure for each node (`id`, `parentId`, `title`, etc.), ensuring the data is predictable.
-   **Analysis Structure**: The prompt mandates a specific order for the main categories (Profiles, Key Claims, Inconsistencies, etc.). This creates a consistent and logical layout for every analysis.
-   **Contextual Linking**: A key innovation is the requirement for a `sourceNodeId` on "Suggested Motion" nodes. The prompt instructs the AI to link a motion back to the specific claim or inconsistency that justifies it. This allows the front-end to retrieve context (like counter-arguments or fact-checks) when generating the motion document.

### 2. Contextual Action Prompts

These are shorter prompts for specific, user-initiated actions.

-   **Counter-Arguments (`getAlternativePerspective`)**:
    -   **Persona**: "Expert debater and critical thinker."
    -   **Goal**: Act as a "devil's advocate" to challenge a specific point.
    -   **Technique**: Uses a higher `temperature` (0.7) to encourage more creative and diverse counter-arguments.
-   **Fact-Checking (`factCheckClaim`)**:
    -   **Persona**: "Neutral fact-checker."
    -   **Tooling**: This is a key example of function calling. The prompt config includes `tools: [{googleSearch: {}}]`, which gives the model access to Google Search.
    -   **Grounding**: The prompt instructs the model to base its summary *only* on the search results. The front-end then extracts the summary and the source URLs from the `groundingMetadata` in the response.
-   **Motion Generation (`generateMotionDocument`)**:
    -   **Persona**: "Expert legal assistant AI."
    -   **Synthesis**: This prompt's primary job is to **synthesize** multiple pieces of information: the base motion type, the justification, and the optional context from user-generated counter-arguments and fact-checks. It is explicitly told *not* to just list the context but to logically integrate it into the formal argument.

### Modifying and Extending the AI

-   **Adding a New Category**: To add a new top-level category to the mind map, you must:
    1.  Add the new category name to the ordered list in the main analysis prompt in `geminiService.ts`.
    2.  Update the `summarizeAnalysisTree` function in `App.tsx` to recognize this new category and its children if you want its data to appear on the Dashboard.
-   **Changing Node Structure**: If you add a new field to the node JSON structure in the prompt, you must also update the TypeScript types in `types.ts` to reflect the change.

## üßë‚Äçüíº Admin Guide

This application is a fully client-side tool. There is no backend server to manage, and no user data is ever sent to a third-party server (aside from the anonymized testimony text sent to the Gemini API for analysis).

-   **Data Storage**: All session data, including the analysis tree and user notes, is stored locally in the browser's **IndexedDB**.
-   **Data Privacy**: Clearing the browser's site data will permanently delete all stored analysis sessions.
-   **No Administration Required**: The application requires zero server-side maintenance or administration.
